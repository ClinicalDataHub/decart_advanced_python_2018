# Creating Packages

In this initial module (-1), we are going to go over the steps of creating packages. This will allow us to make our package with our own code created in this class. We will be following [this](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) tutorial to create the package `myla` (My Linear Algebra).
