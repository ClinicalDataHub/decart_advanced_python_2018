# Advanced Python Programming
## Applications with Linear Algebra

This course will develop advanced programming, debugging, and profiling skills in Python using linear algebra as a domain.

## Programming Skills

* Use of Spyder as an IDE for debugging
* Use of Python profiling code to identify code refactoring opportunities
* Use of Cython or solutions for improved performance

## Linear Algebra Topics

* Vector representation
* Vector algebra
* Matrices
* Matrix multiplication
* Eigenvalues
* Matrix Inversion and SVD

## Prerequisities

Students should have prior Python programming experience (such as the boot camp or equivalent).

Students will need their own laptop with Anaconda installed.
